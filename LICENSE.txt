GNU General Public License v3.0

Copyright (C) 2025 Nandan K P

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You
can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of everyone else.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously
to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to modify software. Therefore, we
must prohibit this practice in modified versions of the software. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains of practical use,
we hope to extend this principle to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program
non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than making an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier
work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you liable for copyright infringement under
applicable law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries
other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An "Object Code" version of a work means a non-source form suitable
for machine execution and usually consisting of object code, related
installation data, and environment data.

A "Corresponding Source" for an object code version means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to permit users to modify and rebuild the
modified version of the object code from the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from the object code.

If the Program (as received in object code or source code form) is
accompanied by materials covered by a separate license, which do not
create obligations inconsistent with this License, such materials are
not part of this License, and you may govern your use of them entirely
by the terms of those licenses.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable the work to be used with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, C library, command shell, etc.) of the specific
operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to permit users to modify and rebuild
the modified version of the object code from the Corresponding
Source. This includes the work's source code, associated build
control files, and the source code of libraries and subroutines that
are required to link (statically or dynamically) the work with the
work, including the System Libraries. It also includes the
Corresponding Source for any part of the work that is covered by a
license whose terms are inconsistent with this License.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from the object code.

If the Program (as received in object code or source code form) is
accompanied by materials covered by a separate license, which do not
create obligations inconsistent with this License, such materials are
not part of this License, and you may govern your use of them entirely
by the terms of those licenses.

If the object code form is provided by offering access to copy
it from a network server, then the Corresponding Source may be
provided by offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place through the same means or from a different
place that is equally easy to access.

2. Basic Permissions.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a suitable
copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

3. Modification.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of section 2 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you modified the files, and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you propagate or convey, that in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole under the terms of this License
to all who come into possession of it.

c) If the modified work normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
the most ordinary way, to print or display an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice stating that the work comes with no warranty
(or else stating that you provide a warranty), that users may
redistribute the work under these conditions, and telling the user
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement.)

A work that contains no portion of the Program, but is designed to
work with the Program by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Program". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
covered work by virtue of being used with the Program. However, linking
a "work that uses the Program" with the Program creates an executable
that is a covered work (rather than a work that uses the Program).
Therefore, the terms of this License cover the entire executable.

When you propagate a covered work, you must convey Corresponding
Source to the recipients under the terms of sections 4 through 12,
for that work.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy a suitable copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you modified the files, and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you propagate or convey, that in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole under the terms of this License
to all who come into possession of it.

c) If the modified work normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
the most ordinary way, to print or display an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice stating that the work comes with no warranty
(or else stating that you provide a warranty), that users may
redistribute the work under these conditions, and telling the user
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement.)

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), along with the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code if they choose not
to. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
you or a third party) that provides equivalent downloading facilities,
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying
where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server
hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that
it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or subverted solely because modification
has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right to possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
a User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no password or key for unpacking,
reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if you have appropriate copyright
permission for that material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provided in
sections 15 and 16; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d) Lim
